# üöó Vehicle Rental System (Java)

A console-based Java application that simulates a simple vehicle rental system. Users can add, remove, rent, and return vehicles ‚Äî including cars, boats, and planes ‚Äî with rental rates dynamically calculated based on vehicle-specific attributes.

## üìå Description

This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, method overriding, and interface implementation (`Comparable`). The system manages a list of vehicles using an `ArrayList` and provides sorting functionality based on rental rate.

It's designed to:
- Handle multiple vehicle types with their own attributes and rate logic
- Allow for renting/returning vehicles
- Show updates to attributes using setters
- Demonstrate `equals()`, `compareTo()`, and `toString()` overrides
- Handle edge cases like trying to rent already rented or unavailable vehicles

## ‚úÖ Features

- Abstract superclass `Vehicle` with shared properties and behavior
- Subclasses: `Car`, `Boat`, and `Plane` with specific attributes:
  - Car ‚Üí seats
  - Boat ‚Üí length
  - Plane ‚Üí engine count and private/commercial type
- Dynamic rental rate calculation based on vehicle type and attributes
- Vehicle comparison using `Comparable` (by rental rate)
- Full inventory management: add, remove, rent, return, display
- Object equality check with `equals()`
- Clear and consistent `toString()` output for each vehicle type
- Console output demonstrating all functionalities and edge cases
